FormExtensions
==============

Symfony2 form extensions for Admingenerator project inspired by 
[genemu/GenemuFormBundle](https://github.com/genemu/GenemuFormBundle).

This bundle provides new form types for Symfony2:
- Bootstrap Collection
- Color Picker

will be moved from Symfony2Admingenerator project to this bundle.

Forms that will be moved to this bundle:
- Upload
- Single Upload

Forms that will be added to this bundle:
- Date picker
- DateTime picker
- DateRange picker

Forms that will be discontinued in Symfony2 Admingenerator project:
- Entity Picker
